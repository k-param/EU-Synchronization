These files are the necessary files to replicate the results for the working paper "Investigating the effect of Trade on Business Cycle Synchronization: An Applied Case to the EU."

There are two data files called: 'bilatagain-rerun.txt' and 'cycles-rerun.txt'

There are two codes for r called:

STAGE - 1 Correlations of cycles-rerun.txt
STAGE 2-FORMAT- twostagedleastsquares-rerun.txt

Put the two data files in to your chosen working directory and then run stage one and two of the code subsequently.
