# EUsynchronisation

These files are the necessary files to replicate the results for the working paper "Investigating the effect of Trade on Business Cycle Synchronization: An Applied Case to the EU."

There are two data files called: 

Dyadic_dataset.txt

Extracted_Cycles.txt'

There are two codes for r called:

Stage 1.txt

Stage 2.txt

Put the two data files in to your chosen working directory and then run stage one and two of the code subsequently.

These codes are written to br run in r.
